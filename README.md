# AI-Written Essays
This is a dataset which contains essays written by AI, namely, OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` model. The code used to generate this dataset is visible in `generate.py`. It is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivaansinghvi07/ai-generated-essays).

## Contents
The dataset is stored in the text file `ai-essays.txt`. Each line contains one essay. In total, there are 2788 lines.

## Limitations
- The AI tends to leave sentences unfinished as it reaches its token limit at the end of the essay.
- The AI leads about one-tenth of the essays with a title.
